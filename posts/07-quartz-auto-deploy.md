# ðŸš€ Auto Deploy Quartz Website

> [!warning] Work in progress

---

## Intro

If you've been keeping up with my earlier blog entries, such as [[01-caddy-in-docker]] and [[06-caddy-for-quartz]], you now have on your server a **Caddy** Docker instance successfully serving a static site powered by **Quartz**.

Given that I edit my notes using multiple devices, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [Obsidian Git plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git), I've been searching for a solution for automatically deploying my **Quartz** changes directly to my server.

![[07-intro.png]]

One straightforward approach is to update the Git repository directly, which is served by Caddy, using the `git pull` command, followed by rebuilding the static files. However, this method requires continuous access to the server and involves a relatively manual process.

In this guide, I will demonstrate how to update your server repository by leveraging a combination of [Github](https://github.com) Webhooks and **Caddy** configuration.

---

## Create Update Script

Create a `shell` script named `update-quartz` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# /path/to/script/update-quartz

(cd /path/to/quartz && git pull origin main && npx quartz build)
```

This script will update the git repository then rebuild the **Quartz** static files from your notes.

---

## Update Caddy Docker Image

### Caddy Exec Plugin

`caddy-exec` is a **Caddy** plugin designed for executing background shell commands. Its utility becomes evident when employing it to directly run our earlier update script within the **Caddy** environment.

To add the plugin to your **Caddy** docker instance, you can use the `Dockerfile` from [[04-install-caddy-plugins]]:

```dockerfile {2-3}
FROM caddy:builder AS builder
RUN xcaddy build \
	--with github.com/abiosoft/caddy-exec

FROM caddy:latest
COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/caddy /usr/bin/caddy
```

### Script Dependencies

The `update-quartz` also have dependencies that needs to be installed:

```dockerfile {7}
FROM caddy:builder AS builder
RUN xcaddy build \
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â --with github.com/abiosoft/caddy-exec

FROM caddy:latest
COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/caddy /usr/bin/caddy
RUN apk add --update nodejs npm git
```

### Environment

To be able to execute the `update-quartz` command, **Caddy** need the script to be in the `PATH` variable. Edit the `Dockerfile` as follow:

```dockerfile {8}
FROM caddy:builder AS builder
RUN xcaddy build \
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â --with github.com/abiosoft/caddy-exec
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
FROM caddy:latest
COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/caddy /usr/bin/caddy
RUN apk add --update nodejs npm git
ENV PATH="${PATH}:/path/to/script"
```

And add a `volume` mapping the `update-quartz` script on the `docker-cpopose.yml` of **Caddy**:

```yml {16}
version: "3.9"

services:
  caddy:
    image: caddy:latest
    container_name: caddy
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      - "443:443/udp"
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - ./data:/data
      - ./config:/config
      - /path/to/script:/path/to/script

networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: caddy
```

---

## Create Caddy /update Endpoint

Next, let's establish an `/update` endpoint, which will serve as the trigger point for initiating the update of the server's Git repository through Caddy.

From the **Caddy** config of [[06-caddy-for-quartz]], add the configuration below:

```text {3-5}
domain.name {

	route /update {
		exec update-quartz
	}

	root * /path/to/quartz/public
	try_files {path} {path.html}
	file_server

	handle_errors {
		@404-410 expression `{err.status_code} in [404, 410]`
		handle @404-410 {
			root * /path/to/quartz/public
			rewrite * {err.status_code}.html
			file_server
		}
	}
}
```

With this configuration, the update can be triggered manually by calling the `/update` endpoint on our server.

![[07-endpoint.png]]

This endpoint is currently accessible by all the internet. To create a `basicauth` authentication protection, generate a password hash using the command:

```bash
docker exec -it caddy caddy hash-password
```

For the password `1234`, the output will look like:

```txt
Enter password: Â   
Confirm password: Â   
$2a$14$S9xXKUJUueIzZFFPFhrqQOkCJs.12XeyHSybjpXNBLCLQWli7wIva
```

This command will output a string in the `bcrypt` format by default. You can look at the **Caddy** [hash-password documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line#caddy-hash-password) for more information.

Complete the **Caddy** config file with `basicauth` directive, specifying the `hash-password` output and a `user` that will be used to authenticate:

```text {4-6}
domain.name {

	route /update {
		basicauth {
			user $2a$14$S57sqa8RAHPBTRYvy.GqYOQOoPBeip.zZ9W.yvmQKck61thG72bKy
		}

		exec update-quartz
	}

	root * /path/to/quartz/public
	try_files {path} {path.html}
	file_server

	handle_errors {
		@404-410 expression `{err.status_code} in [404, 410]`
		handle @404-410 {
			root * /path/to/quartz/public
			rewrite * {err.status_code}.html
			file_server
		}
	}
}
```

With this configuration, the endpoint `/update` will be protected with credentials `user`/`1234`.

## Setup Github Webhook

Go to [Github](https://github.com) in `Settings` => `Webhooks` => `Add webhook`.
For the `Payload URL` parameter, set the URL `https://user:1234@domain.name/update`.

![[07-github-screenshot.png]]

By default, webhooks will be triggered on push event. This implies that when you push your modifications to **Quartz** on [Github](https://github.com), the webhook will autonomously activate the `/update` endpoint on your **Caddy** server. Consequently, it will update and rebuild the **Quartz** static files, which are also served by your **Caddy** instance ðŸš€.

## Improve Security

To safeguard your **Caddy** endpoint `/update` from potential brute force attacks, consider implementing custom **Fail2Ban** filters as outlined in the blog post [[05-fail2ban-for-caddy]].

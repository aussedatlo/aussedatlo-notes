## Intro

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority. It's possible to participate to the network by installing a Bitcoin node.

A node ensures you have full control over your transactions, don't rely on other entity, and directly participates in the Bitcoin network's security and decentralization. It empowers you to verify transactions independently, enhancing your privacy and trust in the system.

> Don't trust, verify...

This guide will walk you through the process of installing a Bitcoin node, Electrs, and Mempool using Docker. By leveraging Docker, you can streamline the deployment and management of these services. Whether you're a developer or an enthusiast, this step-by-step tutorial will simplify your setup process. Let's dive into creating a robust and efficient Bitcoin node infrastructure.

## Prerequisite

Before we start, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A server or machine with Docker installed.
- Basic understanding of Docker concepts such as containers, images, and volumes.
- Docker Compose.

## Bitcoin node

To facilitate integration with other services, create a docker network using the command:
```bash
docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=192.168.10.0/28 --gateway=192.168.10.1 bitcoin-network
```

Create a `bitcoin` folder and add the `docker-compose.yml` file with the content below:
```yml
services:
  bitcoin:
    container_name: bitcoind
    user: 1000:1000
    image: lncm/bitcoind:v25.0
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data/.bitcoin
    restart: unless-stopped
    stop_grace_period: 15m30s
    networks:
      bitcoin-network:
        ipv4_address: 192.168.10.2

networks:
  bitcoin-network:
    name: bitcoin-network
    external: true
```

Add the `./data/bitcoin.conf` file with the following content:
```conf
# RPC password
rpcauth=<user>:<password>

# bind on bitcoin-network ip
rpcbind=192.168.10.2
rpcallowip=192.168.10.0/28

# bind on local for bitcoin-cli and other local tools
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1/32
```

You can generate the `<user>` and `<password>` data using the website [https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-rpc-auth-generator/](https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-rpc-auth-generator/). For example for the user `user` and password `password`, the result will be `rpcauth=user:a25ea0ca3f3d8ab20c3dce3959223427$05533202f12c57937a438c329fce23f9d2aff46b66db0d0d5ced785b4e598414`.

You can now start the bitcoin daemon using the command:
```bash
docker cimpose up -d
```

Check the status using the command:
```
docker exec -it bitcoind bitcoin-cli -getinfo
```

The result should be something like:
```
Chain: main
Blocks: 0
Headers: 34041
Verification progress: â–’â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ 0.0000%
Difficulty: 1

Network: in 0, out 7, total 7
Version: 250000
Time offset (s): 0
Proxies: n/a
Min tx relay fee rate (BTC/kvB): 0.00001000

Warnings: (none)
```
